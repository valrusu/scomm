// INPUT:
// order of the files matter in the output; INPUT1 is considered the "old" one and INPUT2 the "new" one
// INPUT1 from FD3
// INPUT2 from DF4

// Example OUTPUT: without -k/-p             with -k/-p/
// OUTPUT1: lines unique to INPUT1
// OUTPUT2: lines unique to INPUT2
// OUTPUT3: lines common                         lines that are common
//                                           INPUT1 lines for which key(INPUT1) exists in INPUT2 but payloads are different
//
// the output is meant like either "delete + merge" (with -m) or "delete + insert" (without -m)
//
// Example OUTPUT: without -k/-p; ignore -l -m (all defaults):
